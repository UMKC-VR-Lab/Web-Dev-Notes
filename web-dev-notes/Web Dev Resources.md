## History of HTML and CSS

[[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as the foundational language for creating web pages. Today, HTML is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

[[CSS]] (Cascading Style Sheets) was created by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1996 to separate content from presentation on the web. CSS is also maintained by the W3C in collaboration with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
